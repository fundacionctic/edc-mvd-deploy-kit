# Issuer Authentication
# Superuser credentials for accessing admin endpoints (base64 encoded)
# Format: base64(username).base64(password)
# Default decodes to: super-user / super-secret-key
# Impact: Required for seeding operations and administrative API calls
# Security: CRITICAL - CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION! Generate new credentials and base64 encode them
# Example: echo -n "admin" | base64 gives YWRtaW4=

# Identity API authentication key
# Used to authenticate requests to the Identity API endpoints
# Impact: Required for identity-related operations (credential requests, verification)
# Security: Change from default 'password' in production
ISSUER_IDENTITY_API_KEY=password

# Issuer Signing Key Configuration
# Alias for the cryptographic key used to sign credentials and status lists
